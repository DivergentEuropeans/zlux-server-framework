# Zlux Server Framework Changelog

All notable changes to the Zlux Server Framework package will be documented in this file.
This repo is part of the app-server Zowe Component, and the change logs here may appear on Zowe.org in that section.

## 1.12.0

- Bugfix: Server handles if implementationDefaults or mediationLayer objects are missing
- Bugfix: SSH connecting from terminal-proxy was very slow on node v12+
- Bugfix: Lease info for mediation layer was a value that caused periodic heartbeat failure
- Add ability to state where a plugin path is relative to, instead of just where the server is running.
- Bugfix: Logout now allows security plugins to clear cookies

- Bugfix: When trying to dynamically load a plugin with unmet dependencies, the response from the server would hang
- Support for reading keys, certificates, and certificate authority content from SAF keyrings via safkeyring:// specification in the node.https configuration object
